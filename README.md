# CJMVincent's dotfiles

![Dotfiles preview](https://github.com/cjmvincent/dotfiles/blob/main/preview.png)

This workflow is to automate the configuration my personal macOS installations. This is a machine I do a lot of tinckering on, and testing things. These are very basic dotfiles, and tailored to my level of knowledge surrounding the concept of programmatic setup. Feel free to explore, copy and re-use the code as you see fit.

## Installation

**Warning**: I recommend you fork and review the code first, before giving these dotfiles a try. Make sure to install the Xcode Command Line Tools by running
`xcode-select --install` first. As well as logging into iCloud and the Apple App Store.

Ideally you should be cloning the repo into your home directory as that's where my scripts will being referring to ðŸ¤–:

    git clone http://github.com/cjmvincent/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && sudo sh ./install.sh

That's about it, I think... I'm sure as time passes, and I learn more things, this repo will evolve.
